# Notpron 

### Start here: http://notpron.com/notpron/notpron.htm

### Level 1:
Link: http://www.notpron.com/notpron/levelone.htm

1. Click on the door.

### Level 2:
Link: http://www.notpron.com/notpron/not/level2.htm

1. Change URL from 'level2.htm' to 'level3.htm'.

### Level 3:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/false/movetotheothersite.php

1. Change URL from 'false' to 'true'.

### Level 4:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/true/movetotheothersite.php

1. Look at the desk with [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code#/media/File:International_Morse_Code.svg) in it. 
2. Upon solving the Morse code, click on the coin and enter the username and password:
    (Password hint: Light this place now).
    - **Username**: voodoo
    - **Password**: magic

### Level 5:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/google/shestheoneforme.php

1. The text "eyes like an angel smiles like a devil" is lyrics from the song "Simple Songs" by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.
2. Enter the username and password:
    (Password hint: live)
    - **Username**: simple
    - **Password**: songs

### Level 6:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/nothing/hesgotitall.php

1. In the source code, we see text "ASCII is the alternative".
2. Upon highlighting the web page entirely, we discover text "108 105 108 107
101 122 111 110".
3. In [ASCII code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters), this code trasnlates to 'lilk ezno'.
4. Enter the username and password after scrambling the two words as hinted by the password hint.
    (Password Hint: anagram)
    - **Username**: kill
    - **Password**: zone

### Level 7:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/sdrawkcab/tieman.htm

1. In the URL we notice "sdrawkcab", which 'backwards' written backwards. Upon changing it we get "no just name it".
2. So we write 'tieman.htm' backwards, which becomes 'nameit.htm', to which we get "No, name what you see on the pic, go back!"
3. In other words, the puzzle requires us to identify the name of the chocolate. We notice the letter X, which points that this chocolate is probably "Twix". Upon writing it backwards, we get 'xiwt.htm', which gives the message "too new". (Note if you put 'twix.htm', you will get the message "wenoot", which is 'too new' written backwards).
4. The answer is probably the old name of Twix, which was Raider. So the answer is 'rediar.htm' (If you write 'raider.htm', you get "dnuorayawrehto", which is 'other way around' written backwards).

### Level 8:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/sdrawkcab/rediar.htm

1. In the source code, we see a second mp3 file, but when we open the file, it doesn't play. JAY PACK in the webpage alludes to JPEG (also hinted by "water turns wine" comment, and password hint "mom, he formatted my second song").
2. When you convert the mp3 file to JPG in the URL, it says we have to rename the file. Meaning the server has "mus2.jpg" file by itself, and we need to download "mp2.mp3" and rename the extension to .jpg, which provides the username and password.
    (Password Hint: mom, he formatted my second song)
    - **Username**: inverted
    - **Password**: tenthlevel

### Level 9:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/luv2music/paulisdead.htm

1. Open the source code, and note that certain letters are in <span> tag. Enter the username and password.
    (Password Hint: colorful)
    - **Username**: turnmeon
    - **Password**: deadman

### Level 10:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/wrong/roawr.htm

1. In the source code we note that the audio file is 'mus3.mp3', which is different from usual 'mus1.mp3', implying it might contain username and password. The title says "he was impatient" and the source code contains the comment "quick quick, don't let me wait", meaning we must speed it up.
2. For this, we will be using the audio tool [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/windows/), and use it to speed the audio 10 times (that's the level) and then reverse it (I think it is hint by 'wrong' in the URL, but not sure to be honest).
    (Password Hint: operator woman said it)
    - **Username**: dark
    - **Password**: times

### Level 11:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/reality/mystery.htm

1. In the source code we see the image 'screen12.jpg', upon changing it to 'screen11.jpg', we get the username and password.
    (Password Hint: follow the truth)
    - **Username**: fucking
    - **Password**: pans

### Level 12:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/blame/crossview.htm

1. As per the source code's comment of "GIF me my picture back", you can change 'realscreen12.jpg' to 'realscreen12.gif' (downloading Dragon.zip does not yield anything meaningful). We see remote control showing the opposite movement and breaking the 3D gif, hence it is the username and password.
    (Password Hint: attention whore)
    - **Username**: remote
    - **Password**: control

### Level 13:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/ps/afterdeath.htm

1.  If you look at image and source code, we see several letter scattered with message "xof5" and so on. The letters are D (xof5), L (5of5), V (3of5), I (xof5) and E(2of5), which leads us to the word "devil". Through this we can guess that Lucy in the title means Lucifer or Satan, and thus the password hint leads to "hell".
    (Password Hint: i live there)
    - **Username**: devil
    - **Password**: hell

### Level 14:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/neo/beenthere.htm

1. The title "He knew the feeling..." and a reference to level 5 leads to a sense of deja vu, which is also supported by the fact that Password hint is in French (the source code mentions "what language is the password hint? use it properly!").
    (Password Hint: quoi?)
    - **Username**: deja
    - **Password**: vu

### Level 15:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/rusty/board.htm

1. The comment is source code is "votre clavier est erroné", which is French for "your keyboard is wrong". Thus the numbers `[1] 4 [2] 1 [3] 6 [2] 3 [1] 9 [3] 7 [2] 1 [3] 3 3 [1] 3 [2] 2 2` refer to keys on keyboard. Upon taking number in square brackets as the row of keyboard, and the following number as the corresponding key on that row, we get the username and password.
    (Password Hint: you are on your own)
    - **Username**: random
    - **Password**: access

### Level 16:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/zoo/mznvh.htm

1. The source code has hints "invert az" and "# = ellwll/hrnkov/proo/...", which gives us "voodoo/simple/kill..." when we invert the alphabet as following. Thus # means alphabet is inverted and we are taking usernames.

`A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z`

`Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A`

2. If we take usernames from mentioned levels and choose character corresponding to the given number, and invert if '#' is present, we get 'doommurder'.
    (Password Hint: déjà vu?)
    - **Username**: doom
    - **Password**: murder

### Level 17:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/finale/pron.htm

1. It's bit of a weird level in the sense I do not still understand how this works. Like there is a connection, but not as strong and obvious as previous levels. I tried 'ufo', 'light' (it says that is too easy), 'bulb' (it says where do you put the bulb in) before 'lamp.htm' worked. I believe this is one of the few limitations of the game that it is slightly centred on Western language and usage, like my first try after 'bulb' was 'socket', which did not exist. If you change the URL to 'notpron.htm', you get pron, and the image has a letter in it. We will be noting these letters in pron for a future level.

`notpron.htm -> o`

### Level 18:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/finale/lamp.htm

1. From the source code we can see 'mus4.mp3' file. I absolutely suck at music theory, so you get someone who can identify the notes and what the hell "A,B,C,D" etc mean. Either way, the notes here play "D, E, A, F, D, E, A, F", thus we get the answer as "deaf".
If someday the answer changes, I would absolutely not be able to tell any difference whatsoever.
2. If you notice the name of image "screen18a.jpg" and try to iterate all the letters, you would find pron. However, in those images you will also notice letters. We will be noting them down for a future level.

`screen18m -> r, screen18p -> n, screen18s -> o, screen18x -> g`

### Level 19:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/finale/deaf.htm

1. The title is "he moved it into the right direction", hinting that the letters are switch right. The source code has "vovtvbm tuvgg" comment, which becomes "unusual stuff", when we move the letters move left.
    (Password Hint: 0_o)
    - **Username**: unusual
    - **Password**: stuff

### Level 20:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/windows/something.php

1. The font in the image is called [Wingdings](https://lingojam.com/WingdingsTranslator), upon translating we get username and password.
    (Password Hint: dont mind the lead/pb)
    - **Username**: really
    - **Password**: unfair

### Level 21:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/twentyone/again.htm

1. The image is named "white.jpg", so we replace the name of JPG image with all colors mentioned in "white.jpg".
2. In GIMP, open all images and superimpose them over each other. This can be doen through:
    - Open color-named images (eg: blue.jpg).
    - Use fuzzy select tool to select the white background, then Select->Invert, or Ctrl+I to select all the region *except* white regions.
    - Cut them and paste them in another image such as "green.jpg". (using Ctrl+V or `Edit -> Paste as -> New layer`, I personally recommend the latter).
    - Do all this, and at the end, cut the letters in black.jpg (you can use fuzzy select tool to select the whitebackground, then Select->Invert, or Ctrl+I) in a similar way and paste it over the colored maze.
    - Note that *light_blue* and *lilac* colours are not used in the the original "white.jpg" image. All other colors have been used (for example, "blue" is written in red color). Hence we will not be using these two images.
 3. Once maze is made, we go from "A to O", or Alpha to Omega 1 and 2 (as seen in white.jpg), which gives our username and password.

    We eventually get the below image:
    ![The solution image](image.png)

    (Password Hint: From A to O)
    - **Username**: getting
    - **Password**: smarter

### Level 22:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/beepbeep/banana.htm

1. Unexpectedly, the answer is correct indeed, the solution is 'unexpected.htm'.
2. Slight detour: we notice that image is named "screen22b.jpg". By changing the letters we can discover more pron, which is found in "screen22x.jpg".

`screen22x -> a`

### Level 23:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/beepbeep/unexpected.htm

1. The title says "I'm the tiniest unit you can see", which is a pixel, so we go to 'pixel.htm'.
2. The message is now "ya, I'm small and red, zoom for me". Upon zooming, we notice some letters are marked by a red pixel (such as the big s in smutje). Look for them using Magnifier set up to 1500%, and we can get the lettets s, o, u, n and d.

### Level 24:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/beepbeep/sound.htm

1. We have typing phone, and what seems like a phone number. Essentially we are asked what does this phone number spells out (like 2 -> abc, 3 -> def and so on). Use the site [Phonespell](https://phonespell.org/phonespell.html) to make it quick and we get the answer.

### Level 25:
Link: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/beepbeep/xylophone.htm

1. The title is "FF0000" which refers to red color in hexadecimal. So we open the image in GIMP, click on channels and view only red channel, which gives us "wlried". Using password hint of "0000FF" or blue color, we can similarly get "vsowls".
2. To obtain the username and password, we need to unscramble the letters.
    (Password Hint: 0000FF)
    - **Username**: wilder
    - **Password**: wolves

### Level 26:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/screen26/

1. The image shows a zip, and there is no ".htm" URL, thus we are essentially looking for "screen26.zip". Upon entering it, this zip file is downloaded.

### Level 27:
Link: screen27.jpg (inside screen26.zip)

1. The image has a banner "need more tits". In other words, we want pron. So edit the URL to make it '/pron/' from '/notpron/'.

### Level 28:
Link: http://notpron.com/pron/screen26/

1. Wrong number, ain't it? That's because the URL has 'screen26' in it. Change it to 'screen29' to go to Level 29.
2. While experimenting with URL, you can also find some pron if you go one directory up.

`http://notpron.com/pron/ -> p`

### Level 29:
Link: http://notpron.com/pron/screen29/

1. We are provided by username and password, but we are still wrong in some way...well we need to change '/pron/' back to '/notpron/', and edit 'screen29' to 'screen30'. We will be prompted for username and password.
    (Password Hint: blumbatsch)
    - **Username**: rockin
    - **Password**: boppin

### Level 30:
Link: http://notpron.com/notpron/screen30/

1. The hint is the image, which is of the creator of Notpron, David Munnich. Entering "david.htm" and "davidm.htm" only prompts us to look where his image can be. We can see his image in the credits section on the home page.
2. When we open the image and click on her, we are redirected to 'team_davidb.jpg'. However, the image itself says that he is not DavidB, so we change URL to 'team_davidm.jpg', which gives us the answer.

### Level 31:
Link: http://notpron.com/notpron/screen30/davidandhism2.htm

1. The only hint is in the title ("He forgot where he took it!), meaning we probably need to download the image and look at its Metadata. In GIMP this can be done by `Image-> Metadata-> View Metadata` option. We see the image was taken in the city of Hirstein.

### Level 32:
Link: http://notpron.com/notpron/screen30/hirstein.htm

1. The image is named "stylishpic32.jpg", which refers to the CSS stylesheet. Opening the stylesheet (style.css) provides us with the answer, "macroscopic".

### Level 33:
Link: http://notpron.com/notpron/screen30/macroscopic.htm

1. The comment in source code hints "be quiet + anakin". We can see from image that "be quiet" probably refers to "stfu", and the title "hit the any key" means we are replacing "Anakin" with "any". 
2. We can use the keyboard in the image to translate "stfuany", giving us the URL 'kewldaz.htm'. This prompts that our keyboard is German, and in German keyboard Z and Y are swapped, this it gets translated to "kewlday.htm".

### Level 34:
Link: http://notpron.com/notpron/screen30/kewlday.htm

1. Fuel - Element 82 (lead) = Unleaded fuel

### Level 35:
Link: http://notpron.com/notpron/screen30/unleadedfuel.htm

1. Googling the co-ordinates (28°23'46''N, 81° 34' 42''W) bring us to Lake Mickey, a Mickey-mouse shaped lake in Florida. Suffice to say, that is our username and password.
    (Password Hint: 81° 34' 42''W)
    - **Username**: mickey
    - **Password**: mouse

### Level 36:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/nomeaning/

1. The image is inside the tags <psd></psd>, meaning it is a Photoshop document, so we change the name of image from '36tbh.jpg' to '36tbh.psd', and then download it and open it in GIMP.
2. In GIMP, we enable all the layers and see extra letters o, b, s, e, and r. Then you increase the brightness and contrast of the base layer and you reveal letter "so V", which makes the word "observe" when looked diagonally, hence the answer is 'observe.htm'. However, if you change the folder name from '/nomeaning/' to 'observe', you will get pron.

`http://deathball.net/notpron/observe/ -> p`

### Level 37:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/nomeaning/observe.htm

1. "Mo, Di, Mi, Do, Fr" denotes the days of the week on calendar. The date in the title '080135' is of January 8, 1935. This day was Tuesday, or Dienstag in German, however none of those work.
2. When we google January 8, 1935 on Wikipedia, we see it was birthday of Elvis Presley. Typing 'elvis.htm' gives us the answer.

### Level 38:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/nomeaning/elvis2.htm

1. The source code gives us hint "MSN" and the image name "38messenger.jpg" hints to MSN Messenger. Indeed the image has [emotions for MSN Messenger](https://github.com/Crissov/unicode-proposals/issues/256), with each of them corresponding to a single letter. Here we have Coffee (C), Drink (D), Envelope (E), so the next in line is Flower (F).

### Level 39:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/nomeaning/flower.htm

1. The source code hints "53;51;49;56;48;48;56", which contains [ASCII values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters) of the digits. 
2. This gives us "5318008", which shows "Boobies" when entered into a calculator, hence the answer is "boobies.htm".


### Level 40:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/nomeaning/stfuandgetmetothefuckingscreen40.htm

1. This one is a bit subtle. The title of the page "Cuarenta", is Spanish for 40. When you look at the level number 40 in the image and zoom it, you see "next" written in a faint blue font.

### Level 41:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/nomeaning/next.htm

1. In the source code we notice a different sound file called "meep1.mp3". Downloading it and opening it in Audacity doesn't yield any relevant information, so we try "meep2.mp3" and get an audio file with Morse code in it.
2. Opening the file in Audacity and translating it from [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code#/media/File:International_Morse_Code.svg) gives us the answer "genius".


### Level 42:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/nomeaning/genius.htm

1. If you select the screen upto bottom, you will see "22 15 15 4 15 15", the letters which correspond these positions form the word "voodoo", which should immedietaly send us to Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. The band leader is a guy named Scotty Morris, who probably wrote the song.

### Level 43:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/nomeaning/scottymorris.htm

1. The image is called "43small.jpg", change it to "43big.jpg", and upon zooming in we see text "very small" over the clock.

### Level 44:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/nomeaning/verysmall.htm

1. The hint in source code is "all craziness on a stick". We can make this stick by lining all black squares in a single column, thus the below image will be formed with the answer "blow".
![Solution image](Untitled.jpg)

### Level 45:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/nomeaning/blow.htm

1. We see a lot of references to numbers in source code. The image is titled "quarenta" (40 in Portugues), "cuarenta y uno" (41 in Spanish), the title is "quarante-deux" (42 in French), there is a comment with "drieënveertig" (43 in Dutch), the image has a light "vierundvierzig" (44 in German) and the level is femogfyrre (45 in Danish). If you go all these countries geographically, the next number will be 46 in Swedish: "fyrtiosex".

### Level 46:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/nomeaning/fyrtiosex.htm

1. The image is "46a.jpg", we find there is a "46b.jpg" as well. We overlay them each other to see certain letters visible in the boxes.
2. To get the username and password form, we need to click the link from the source code.
    (Password Hint: criss cross)
    - **Username**: extra
    - **Password**: fun

### Level 47:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/threethreethree/

1. The title says "? o_o dbm o_o Ab7 o_o dbm", meaning we need to find the tone left out.
2. Apparently it is a "G flat diminished" tone. Same as adim, cdim, d#dim, f#dim, eb#dim. Putting for example 'adim.htm' will give you answer 'gbdim.htm'. I don't how this works to be honest, because I don't know an ounce of music theory.

### Level 48:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/threethreethree/gbdim.htm

1. The title "AGCGCGATTAACACCAGCGAAGTGGAA" seems like DNA encoding, where a DNA molecule contains A, C, G, and T bases.
2. Use am online [DNA translator tool](https://en.vectorbuilder.com/tool/dna-translation.html) to decrypt the message, and we get "saintseve" as the answer.

### Level 49:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/threethreethree/saintseve.php

1. The hint is source code says "USA vs GERMANY". It gives examples of "LBS v KG" and "INCH v CM", so we have to find German equivalent to stuff mentioned in password hint.
    (Password Hint: 911:dollarfahrenheit)
    - **Username**: 112
    - **Password**: eurocelsius

### Level 50:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/flutsch/index.htm

1. The image looks like a laser (if you type 'light', it will point to 'laser' as well).

### Level 51:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/flutsch/laser.htm

1. It's image of a tower.

### Level 52:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/flutsch/tower.htm

1. It's an image of a tree.

### Level 53:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/flutsch/tree.htm

1. It's the image of a road.

### Level 50A:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/flutsch/road.htm

1. Well Levels 50-53 previously were bit of a joke. Guess we have solve this one for real.
2. In the source code, we see two web pages in frame tags. Open the both web pages and look at the source code. The source of 'top.htm' is quite long, but at the end of it 'boring.htm' is written.

### Level 51A:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/flutsch/boring.htm

1. The image is of the game "Minesweeper", and the title "Unfair!" alludes to some form of cheating. A bit of googling will tell you about a Minesweeper cheatcode back in the day called "xyzzy", which was used to reveal the mines on Windows XP and earlier. Windows 7 onwards there was no such bug.

### Level 52A:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/flutsch/xyzzy.htm
 
1. The title is "Case sensitive", meaning the pins have to do something with the fact if they are capital city or not. Use a [map of Europe](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Europe/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x46ed8886cfadda85:0x72ef99e6b3fcf079?sa=X&ved=1t:242&ictx=111) for reference.
2. The image has an outline of Herbie, the Volkwagen Beetle just under the map (it's eyes are close to the British Isles), hinting for car codes. Thus we are looking for [International Vehicle registration codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_vehicle_registration_code#Current_codes).
3. Countries for which pins match with capital cities, and their vehicle registration codes are: Spain (E), Belgium (B), Luxembourg (L), Austria (A), and Switzerland (CH). The letter arrange to form the word "bleach".

### Level 53A:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/flutsch/bleach.htm

1. The audio is source code is 'music256.mp3', however we need to check for the end of the 'leet song', so we add leet (or 1337) to the audio file name, and edit it to 'music1337.mp3', which gives us the answer.

### Level 54:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/flutsch/me.htm

1. The hint in comment say "<--fucking right", while pointing to the <html> tag. So we change ".htm" in the URL to ".html", that leads us to the actual level 54.

### Level 54A:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/flutsch/me.html

1. The image has name of elements Platinum, Yttrium and Erbium, which number pointing how many letters should we take from each word. This gives 'PlaYEr'.

### Level 55:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/flutsch/player.htm

1. The image is called "worst.jpg", and has the letter 't' in it. We can check the same for 'worse' ('g'), 'bad' ('e'), 'good' ('n'), 'better' ('l') and 'best' ('e'). The letters form the word 'gentle'.

### Level 56:
Link: http://deathball.net/notpron/flutsch/gentle.htm

1. In the source code, we see the image is actual a GIF file, which shows some text every few seconds. When you convert it to a JPG image, we are seen four orange dots.
2. As the title is 'Think outside the box', the aim here is to determine the letters outside the box made by orange dots. You can achieve this by taking a screenshot of both GIF file with text and the JPG image with orange dots and overplaying one over other in GIMP. I did it in Paint as seen below:

1. In the image we see telephone booth with +90 telephone code, this is the country calling code of Turkey. In the source code we see hint "a 488", and upon searching [area codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbers_in_Turkey#List_of_area_codes) for 488, we see it is for a region called "Batman".

1. The image says "turnback" and source code has comment "been lead the wrong way?", so we better go back to level 57 and check the source code as to where we were being sent to. Turns out we were being sent to "index.htm", and then redirected to "wrongroad.htm". The source code in "index.htm" does give us the right answer: to go to "verse.htm".

1. The poem goes:
    *In my head there's only you,*
    *the one that made my dreams come true*
    *when you are not around*
    *you make poor heart pound*
    *you're the one that I'll always love*
    *and be forever dreaming of*

The answer is money.

1. Okay I officially hate rounds based on music theory, it is annoying because I absolutely suck at these.
2. Anyways, we need to open "song.mp3" audio, and the image is named "octaved.jpg", hinting that the song is being played a few octaves lower. The song is Beethoven's 'Fur Elise', being played two octaves lower and the notes being scattered.
3. Coming to the solution, 'Fur Elise' was widely reported to be written for Therese Malfatti, leading to 'therese.htm'.
